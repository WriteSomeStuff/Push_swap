# Push_swap - @Codam
Implementation of a sorting algorithm to sort a doubly linked list with positive and negative numbers as input.

## How does it work?

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WriteSomeStuff/Push_swap.git
cd Push_swap
make
to see the instructions used: ./push_swap 2 -1 6 244 100
or
bash
ARGS="$(ruby -e "puts (1..500).to_a.shuffle.join(' ')")"; ./push_swap $ARGS | ./checker_OS $ARGS; ./push_swap $ARGS | wc -l
```
